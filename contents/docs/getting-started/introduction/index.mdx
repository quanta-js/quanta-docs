## A Taste of the Magic

Here’s a sneak peek at what QuantaJS can do:

```javascript
import { createStore } from "quantajs";

const counter = createStore({
  state: { count: 0 },
  actions: { increment() { this.count++; } },
});

counter.increment(); // Boom! State updates, reactivity kicks in.
console.log(counter.count); // 1—simple, yet powerful.
```
